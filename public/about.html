<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a solid foundation in circuit design, programming, and troubleshooting, I bring strong technical skills and problem-solving abilities to the table. I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team and continue to grow in the exciting field of electronic engineering and computer technology.</p>

<p>During my internship at ***** Berhad from *****, ****, to ****, ****, I gained valuable experience providing technical support to over 25 end users, addressing and resolving various IT issues to ensure smooth operations. I actively contributed to IT-related projects, including a Stress Test Project where I helped assess system performance and identify potential bottlenecks, and a New Device Setup initiative, where I was involved in the deployment and configuration of new hardware and software. Additionally, I was responsible for installing and configuring computer systems, software, and applications, tailoring these setups to meet the specific needs of the organization and its users.</p>
